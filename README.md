# slackGpt3

This repository contains the source code for a Slack bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses to messages. The bot listens for messages in Slack channels or direct messages that contain the @openai mention, and uses GPT-3 to generate a response based on the message text.
