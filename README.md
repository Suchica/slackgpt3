# OpenAI Slack Bot

## Description

This application is a free Slack bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses to messages that mention the @openai bot. The goal of the app is to make it easier for you to access and use GPT-3 in your daily conversations on Slack.

To use the app, you will need to have a Slack account and an OpenAI API key. Once you have installed the bot in your Slack workspace, you can mention the @openai bot in your messages to generate responses. The bot uses the GPT-3 model to generate responses based on the context of the conversation, so the responses will be relevant and natural-sounding.

One advantage of using this app is that it allows you to access GPT-3 in the familiar Slack chat interface, rather than using a separate tool such as chatGPT from a browser. This may make it easier and more convenient for you to access GPT-3 and use it in your daily conversations.

Please note that the text of questions posed to @openai is not saved within this app. However, it may be saved in OpenAI's data, depending on OpenAI's policy. Please refer to OpenAI's policy regarding the use and storage of data for more information.

We are offering this app for free and would appreciate feedback on its use. This way, we can improve the app and make it more useful for users. If you have any suggestions or comments, please don't hesitate to let us know. Thank you for using this app!
